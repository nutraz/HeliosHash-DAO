### 🔄 **Development Workflow (Testnet Only)**

1. **Feature Development** → Create feature branch from `main`
2. **Component Building** → Build in `src/components/` with TypeScript
3. **Testing** → Add unit tests (Vitest) and E2E tests (Playwright)
4. **Canister Integration** → Connect with Motoko canisters via DFX (testnet)
5. **Quality Assurance** → Use manual testing guides and automated tests
6. **Testnet Deployment** → Deploy to IC testnet via `dfx deploy` (NEVER mainnet)

**🔴 CRITICAL:** All development must occur on testnet. Mainnet deployment prohibited until audits complete.
