# HeliosHash DAO Revenue Portfolio Framework

**Urgam Valley Solar Energy Pilot - Sustainable Revenue Strategy**

## Executive Summary

The HeliosHash DAO revenue model follows a **tiered diversification strategy** designed to minimize risk while maximizing community benefit. This framework prioritizes stable, guaranteed revenue streams while strategically allocating capacity for higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities.

## Revenue Portfolio Structure

- **Implementation**: Net metering with Uttarakhand State Electricity Board
- **Revenue**: ₹4-6/kWh for solar power fed back to grid
- **Policy Framework**: UERC (Uttarakhand Electricity Regulatory Commission) net metering approved 2021
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium (policy changes possible but infrastructure investment protects rates)
- **Projected Annual**: ₹2-4 lakh based on 10kW+ installation

#### Agricultural Services Hub

- **Cold Storage**: Solar-powered cold chain for apple harvest and herb preservation
  - Target: Valley's apple orchards and medicinal herb farmers
  - Revenue: ₹20,000-50,000/month during harvest season
  - Equipment: Solar refrigeration units, controlled atmosphere storage

- **Irrigation Services**: Solar pump rental and maintenance
  - Target: 15+ farms within 5km radius of Urgam
  - Revenue: ₹15,000-30,000/month during growing season

### Tier 3 - Mining & Speculative (10-20% allocation)

_Opportunistic revenue during energy surplus periods_

#### Dynamic Computing Services

- **Bitcoin Mining**: Only during peak solar production and grid surplus
  - Adaptive scheduling based on energy availability
  - Revenue: ₹5,000-30,000/month (highly variable)

- **Proof of Useful Work**:
  - Folding@home for medical research
  - Climate modeling computations
  - Revenue: ₹2,000-8,000/month + social impact credits

- **Render Farms**:
  - 3D rendering services for Dehradun/Delhi studios
  - Video processing for local content creators
  - Revenue: ₹8,000-20,000/month

- **Adaptive Strategy**: Switch between services based on profitability and energy availability

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Foundation

1. **Grid Connection & Net Metering**: Establish UERC-compliant solar installation
2. **Cold Storage Pilot**: Single unit for apple harvest season
3. **Community Partnerships**: MOUs with local farmers and cooperatives

### Phase 2 (Months 6-12): Service Expansion

1. **Irrigation Network**: Deploy 3-5 solar pump installations
2. **Edge Computing Hub**: Basic CDN and storage services
3. **DAO Governance**: Community voting on service priorities

### Phase 3 (Months 12-18): Technology Integration

1. **IoT Sensor Network**: Valley-wide monitoring system
2. **AI Services**: Crop analysis and prediction models
3. **Mining Operations**: Surplus energy monetization

## Risk Management & Sustainability

### Revenue Stability Matrix

- **High Certainty (70%)**: Grid feed-in + agricultural services
- **Medium Certainty (20%)**: Edge computing services
