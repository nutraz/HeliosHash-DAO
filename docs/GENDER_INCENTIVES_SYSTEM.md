- **Amount**: 20% additional tokens on all transactions
- **Tracking**: Cumulative bonus tracking in member profiles
- **Transparency**: Publicly visible bonus earnings on leaderboard

### 2. **Priority Job Access System**

```motoko
// Priority scoring for job applications
var priorityScore : Nat = 50; // Base score
switch (member.gender) {
  case (#Female) {
    priorityScore := priorityScore + 30; // +30 priority points
  };
  case (_) {};
};
```

**Eligible Positions:**

- Solar Technician Roles
- Data Steward Positions
- Community Leadership Roles
- Training and Education Coordinators

**Scoring System:**

- Base Score: 50 points (all members)
- Women's Bonus: +30 points
- Mentorship Bonus: +10 additional points
- Experience Multipliers: Variable based on prior contributions

### 3. **Micro-Grant Program (‚Çπ5,000 - ‚Çπ20,000)**

```motoko
// Grant eligibility and validation
if (requestedAmount < 5_000_000 or requestedAmount > 20_000_000) {
  return #err("Grant amount must be between ‚Çπ5,000 and ‚Çπ20,000");
};

switch (member.gender) {
  case (#Female) {
    // Process grant application
  };
  case (_) {
    return #err("Micro-grants are currently available only for women members");
  };
};
```

**Grant Categories:**

- **Solar Technology Projects**: Equipment purchase, installation training
- **Business Development**: Entrepreneurship, cooperative formation

4. Progress monitoring and milestone tracking

### 4. **NFT Badge Achievement System**

```motoko
// Badge templates and automated minting
private let nftBadgeTemplates : [NFTBadge] = [
  {
    badgeId = "solar_sister_001";
    name = "Solar Sister";
    description = "Pioneering women in renewable energy";
    imageUrl = "ipfs://Qm...SolarSister";
  },
  {
    badgeId = "urgam_changemaker_001";
    name = "Urgam Changemaker";

let membershipDuration = Time.now() - member.joinDate;
let sixMonthsNanos : Int = 6 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1_000_000_000;

if (membershipDuration < sixMonthsNanos) {
  return #err("Minimum 6 months membership required for mentorship");
};
```

**Program Structure:**
