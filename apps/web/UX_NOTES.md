HeliosHash Web — UX Notes
=========================

This file summarizes the updated onboarding roles, support & dispute placement, and police QR verification flow.

Roles
-----
- Multi-select grid during onboarding.
- Persistent and editable in `Settings → Roles & Permissions`.
- Stored minimally in `localStorage` (key: `helioshash_user`) and synced with `AuthContext`.

Support & Dispute
-----------------
- Global Support & Dispute center (top-level navigation): general reports, appeals, wallet/NFT issues.
- Project-level Support: disputes tied to a specific project (land, payment, milestone evidence).
- Each project includes built-in police QR verification and dispute paths.

Police QR Flow
-------------
- Each milestone has a QR code generated by the project backend.
- Officials scan QR to access verification page and upload evidence.
- Evidence is recorded and triggers notifications for DAO/community.

Notes
-----
- Role selector implemented at `/auth/onboarding/roles` and component is `src/components/RoleSelector/RoleSelector.tsx`.
- AuthContext persists and hydrates minimal profile (principal, name, avatar, roles) to `localStorage`.
