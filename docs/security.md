# Security Practices & Audit Status

## Current Security Posture (MVP)
- **Authentication:** Simulated (localStorage/mock); not production-ready
- **State:** In-memory only; no persistent storage
- **Canister Boundaries:** Business logic isolated in Motoko canisters
- **Frontend:** No sensitive data exposed; only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars used
- **Testing:** Automated and manual tests for core flows

## Planned Security Enhancements
- **Production Authentication:** Integration with Internet Identity or equivalent
- **Audit:** Third-party security audit planned for post-MVP
- **Persistent Storage:** Secure, auditable state management
- **Governance:** On-chain proposal and voting security

## Security Audit Results
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: No formal audit completed as of October 2025.**
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Smart contracts are UNAUDITED and NOT SAFE for production use.**
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: No funds should be deposited until professional audit completion.**
- All code is open source and available for community review.
- Security issues can be reported via GitHub Issues.
- **REQUIRED: Engage reputable auditors (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, CertiK) before any production deployment.**
