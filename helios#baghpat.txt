```motoko
// Pseudo-Motoko Code Structure for the RWA Module

actor SolarMiningRWA {
  // ========== STATE ==========
  private var liveData : LiveData = // Struct for IoT data
  private var projectTreasury : Treasury = // Project-specific wallet
  private var landownerShare : Nat = 7; // 7% from signed agreement
  private var revenueLog : [RevenueDistribution] = [];

  // ========== UPDATE CALLS (Write) ==========
  // Called by IoT Oracles every 15 minutes
  public shared func updateLiveData(newData : LiveData) : async () {
    liveData := newData;
    // Trigger alerts if metrics are out of bounds
  };

  // DAO-triggered function for monthly revenue distribution
  public shared func distributeRevenue() : async () {
    let netRevenue = await calculateNetRevenue();
    let landownerPayout = (netRevenue * landownerShare) / 100;
    let daoTreasuryPayout = netRevenue - landownerPayout;

    // Transfer to landowner's registered wallet (USDC)
    await transferUSDC(landownerWallet, landownerPayout);
    // Transfer remainder to main DAO Treasury
    await transferUSDC(daoTreasury, daoTreasuryPayout);

    // Log the transaction on-chain
    revenueLog := append(revenueLog, {
      timestamp = Time.now();
      landownerPayout;
      daoTreasuryPayout;
    });
  };

  // ========== QUERY CALLS (Read) ==========
  // For the main dashboard
  public query func getLiveDashboard() : async DashboardView {
    return {
      currentHashrate = liveData.hashrate;
      dailyEnergyProd = liveData.energy_kWh;
      estimatedDailyRevenue = calculateDailyRevenue(liveData.hashrate);
      systemHealth = liveData.healthStatus;
    };
  };

  public query func getLandownerDetails() : async LandownerInfo {
    return {
      walletAddress = landownerWallet;
      sharePercentage = landownerShare;
      totalEarnedToDate = calculateTotalEarned();
      nextPayoutDate = getNextPayoutDate();
    };
  };
}
```
