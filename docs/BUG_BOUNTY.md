## üîç Vulnerability Assessment Guide

### Severity Criteria

We use the following framework to assess severity:

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0 - 10.0)

- Direct theft of funds
- Permanent freezing of funds
- Governance takeover
- Protocol insolvency
- Remote code execution

**Example:** "Reentrancy vulnerability in treasury canister allows attacker to drain all OWP tokens"

#### High (CVSS 7.0 - 8.9)

- Temporary freezing of funds
- Theft of unclaimed yield
- Unauthorized access to PII/KYC data
- Privilege escalation
- Theft of NFT rewards

**Example:** "Authentication bypass allows access to any user's dashboard and KYC information"

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0 - 6.9)

- Information disclosure
- Smart contract griefing
- Manipulation of non-critical functions
- CSRF on sensitive operations

**Example:** "XSS vulnerability in job board allows stealing session tokens"

#### Low (CVSS 0.1 - 3.9)

- Best practice violations
- Missing security headers
- Low-impact information disclosure
- Self-XSS requiring social engineering

**Example:** "Missing CSP header allows inline scripts on non-sensitive pages"

### Impact Assessment

Consider these factors:

1. **Financial Impact**: Can funds be stolen or locked?
2. **Data Exposure**: Is PII/KYC data compromised?
3. **Governance Risk**: Can voting be manipulated?
4. **User Impact**: How many users are affected?
5. **Exploitability**: How easy is it to exploit?
6. **Privilege Required**: Does it require authentication?

## üéì Researcher Tips

### What We Value

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Well-researched, detailed reports
2. **Proof of Concept**: Working exploits demonstrate impact
3. **Fix Recommendations**: Show us how to remediate
4. **Clear Communication**: Make it easy for us to reproduce
5. **Responsible Disclosure**: Follow our coordinated disclosure timeline

### Report Writing Best Practices

**Good Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Title: Reentrancy vulnerability in Treasury Canister

## Severity: Critical

## Summary
The `withdraw()` function in the treasury canister is vulnerable to 
reentrancy attacks, allowing an attacker to drain all funds.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Deploy malicious canister at [address]
2. Call `invest()` with 100 OWP tokens
3. Call `withdraw()` which triggers callback
4. In callback, recursively call `withdraw()` before state update
5. Successfully withdraw 1000 OWP tokens (10x initial investment)

## Proof of Concept
[Include code, screenshots, or video]

## Impact
An attacker can drain the entire treasury (~$500K USD at current prices).
This affects all 150+ community members and stops all solar projects.

## Recommended Fix
Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern:
[Provide code example]

## Timeline
Discovered: October 15, 2025
Reported: October 19, 2025
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ‚ùå Vague descriptions without reproduction steps
- ‚ùå No proof of concept or impact assessment
- ‚ùå Testing on production with real user data
- ‚ùå Demanding payment before providing full details
- ‚ùå Public disclosure before coordinated timeline
- ‚ùå Automated scanner output without validation
