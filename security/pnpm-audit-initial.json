If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n* Next.js (`<14.1.1`) is running in a self-hosted* manner.\n* The Next.js application makes use of Server Actions.\n* The Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`.\n\n\\* Many hosting providers (including Vercel) route requests based on the Host header, so we do not believe that this vulnerability affects any Next.js applications where routing is done in this manner.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability was patched in [#62561](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62561) and fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.\n \n### Workarounds\nThere are no official workarounds for this vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to Next.js `14.1.1`.\n\n### Credit\nVercel and the Next.js team thank Assetnote for responsibly disclosing this issue to us, and for working with us to verify the fix.

When this crafted request is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache a route that is meant to not be cached and send a `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate` header which some upstream CDNs may cache as well. \n\nTo be potentially affected all of the following must apply: \n\n- Next.js between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9\n- Using pages router\n- Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g. `pages/dashboard.tsx` not `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`\n\nThe below configurations are unaffected:\n\n- Deployments using only app router\n- Deployments on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) are not affected\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability was resolved in Next.js v13.5.7, v14.2.10, and later. We recommend upgrading regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no official or recommended workarounds for this issue, we recommend that users patch to a safe version.\n\n#### Credits\n\n- Allam Rachid (zhero_)\n- Henry Chen",
