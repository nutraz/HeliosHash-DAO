# Treasury Management Policy

## Overview

The HeliosHash DAO (HHDAO) treasury serves as the financial backbone for sustainable development, community grants, and operational stability. This policy outlines our approach to treasury diversification, asset allocation, and transparent fund management aligned with GitBook principles for progressive decentralization.

## Treasury Diversification Strategy

### Asset Allocation

Our treasury will be diversified across multiple asset classes to mitigate volatility and ensure long-term stability:

- **50% Stablecoins (USDC, USDT)**: Primary reserve for operational expenses and emergency funds
- **30% Native Tokens (OWP, HHDAO)**: Ecosystem participation and governance rights
- **15% Ethereum (ETH)**: Gas fees and DeFi opportunities
- **5% NFTs/Collectibles**: Community engagement and future revenue streams

**Rebalancing Protocol:**
- Quarterly rebalancing when allocations deviate by >10% from targets
- Community governance approval required for rebalancing decisions
- Emergency rebalancing allowed with 75% supermajority for market volatility events



## Community Grants Program

### Program Overview

The Community Grants Program funds proposals that advance HHDAO's mission of solar energy access, women's empowerment, and rural development in India.

### Grant Categories

1. **Technical Development**: Smart contract audits, security enhancements, mobile app development
2. **Community Outreach**: Education programs, local partnerships, awareness campaigns
3. **Research & Innovation**: Energy efficiency studies, blockchain applications for social good
4. **Women's Empowerment**: Skills training, entrepreneurship support, digital literacy programs

### Application Process

1. **Proposal Submission**: Submit detailed proposal via governance forum including:
   - Project description and objectives
   - Budget breakdown and justification
   - Timeline and milestones
   - Impact metrics and success criteria
   - Team background and capabilities

2. **Community Review**: 2-week public review period for feedback and questions

3. **Quadratic Voting**: Community approval using quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance

4. **Milestone-Based Funding**: Approved grants released in phases:
   - 30% initial disbursement upon approval
   - 40% upon completion of first milestone
   - 30% upon final project completion and evaluation

5. **Progress Reporting**: Monthly updates required with proof of work
6. **Final Evaluation**: Community voting on project success and impact

### Funding Limits

- Individual grants: $500 - $10,000
- Total quarterly allocation: 20% of treasury growth
- Emergency grants: Up to $50,000 (requires 75% supermajority)

## Treasury Operations

### Multisig Governance

All treasury operations require multisig approval with the following structure:
- 4-of-7 multisig for routine operations
- 6-of-7 multisig for large transfers (>10% of treasury)
- 7-of-7 multisig for emergency actions

### Transparency Requirements

- Monthly treasury reports published on-chain
- Real-time balance tracking via dashboard
- Public audit trail for all transactions
- Community voting on major allocations

## Risk Management

### Volatility Mitigation

- Stablecoin reserves for operational continuity
- Hedging strategies for crypto exposure
- Diversification across multiple blockchains

### Security Measures

- Cold storage for majority of funds
- Regular security audits of treasury contracts
- Insurance coverage for smart contract risks
- Emergency response protocols

## Future Evolution

As HHDAO progresses toward DAO 3.0, treasury management will incorporate:
- **Automated yield optimization**: Smart contract-based yield farming and liquidity provision
- **Decentralized investment committees**: Community-elected investment stewards with term limits
- **Community-directed asset management**: Quadratic voting for investment decisions
- **Integration with regenerative finance principles**: Impact investing aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals
- **Modular treasury components**: Women's incentive system as adaptable template for specialized funds

## Implementation Timeline

- **Q4 2025**: Policy finalization and initial allocation
- **Q1 2026**: Community Grants Program launch with quadratic voting
- **Q2 2026**: Advanced treasury tools deployment (automated rebalancing, yield optimization)
- **Q3 2026**: Full decentralization of treasury operations
- **Q4 2026**: DAO 3.0 treasury evolution - modular, human-centric structures
