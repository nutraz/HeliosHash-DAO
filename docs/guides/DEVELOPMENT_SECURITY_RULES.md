# Development Security Rules

## Core Security Principles

### 🔐 Secrets Management
- **Never commit secrets** — Use `.env.local` for local development (automatically gitignored)
- All sensitive data (API keys, private keys, credentials) must be stored in environment variables
- Never hardcode secrets in source code

### 💰 Financial Safety
- **Never use real funds** — Testnet and mock data only
- All financial operations must use test networks during development
- Real fund transactions are strictly prohibited until full security audit completion

### 🚫 Deployment Restrictions
- **Never deploy to mainnet** — Prohibited until professional security audit is complete
- All deployments must target testnet or local development environments
- Mainnet deployment requires explicit approval from security team

### 🛡️ Input Validation
- **Always validate user input** — Implement XSS and injection prevention
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
- Implement proper input length limits and type checking

### ⚡ Error Handling (Motoko)
- **Always use Result.Result** — Proper error handling in Motoko canisters
- Return `Result.Result<T, E>` for all canister functions
- Avoid throwing exceptions; use proper error types
- Log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive information

### 🐛 Vulnerability Reporting
- **Report vulnerabilities privately** — See SECURITY.md for reporting procedures
- Do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Use designated private channels for security disclosures

## Implementation Checklist

### For Contributors:
- [ ] Review and acknowledge these security rules
- [ ] Configure `.env.local` for local development
- [ ] Ensure all financial operations use testnet
- [ ] Implement input validation for all user-facing endpoints
- [ ] Use Result.Result in all Motoko canister functions
- [ ] Follow vulnerability reporting procedures

### Code Review Requirements:
- [ ] Secrets are not committed to repository
- [ ] User inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Error handling follows Result.Result pattern
- [ ] Testnet/mainnet usage is clearly documented
- [ ] Security implications are considered in design decisions

## Enforcement

Violations of these rules may result in:
- Immediate code rollback
- Access restrictions to production systems
- Mandatory security training
- Potential project removal for severe violations
