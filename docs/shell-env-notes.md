# Shell Environment Notes

## Missing `/dfx/env` Warning

If you see a message like:

```
/dfx/env: No such file or directory
```

it means your shell startup file (e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`) has a line sourcing a non-existent DFX environment script:

```bash
source /dfx/env
```

### Options to Resolve

1. Remove or comment out the line:

```bash
# source /dfx/env
```

2. Or create a placeholder file if you plan to populate it later:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /dfx
sudo touch /dfx/env
```

3. Prefer a user-local path if this was meant to reference the dfx installation:
   Check `which dfx` and related env scripts in `$HOME/.cache/dfx/`.

### Recommendation

If you are not customizing environment variables for `dfx` globally, simply comment out the line to avoid the warning.
