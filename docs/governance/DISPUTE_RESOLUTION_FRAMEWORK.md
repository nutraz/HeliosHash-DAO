    category: DisputeCategory,
    involvedParties: [Principal],
    requestedResolution: Text,
    evidence: [Text] // IPFS hashes or document references
) : async Result.Result<Nat, Text>
```

### Automatic Level Assignment

```motoko
public func determineDisputeLevel(
    category: DisputeCategory,
    financialAmount: ?Nat,
    isConstitutional: Bool
) : DisputeLevel
```

### Timeline Enforcement

```motoko
public func checkDisputeTimeouts() : async [Nat] // Returns expired dispute IDs
```

### Resolution Recording

```motoko
public shared ({ caller }) func recordResolution(
    disputeId: Nat,
    resolution: Text,
