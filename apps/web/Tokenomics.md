# 1WP DAO STRUCTURE: Tokenomics Models for a Sustainable Ecosystem

Ensuring a healthy sustainable eco-system relies on intensive financial modeling. We want all our large community DAOs to be successful. As such, developing a robust deflationary model for them offers stability and longevity. We have collaborated with our partners at Machinations, a technology specializing in economic modeling, to meticulously assess thousands of variables to construct a resilient foundation.

The framework incorporates a design that actively recognizes and rewards loyalty, fostering long-term engagement. The deflationary nature of the initial supply of 19825 memberships will consistently reduce as members ascend through the tiers by burning NFT memberships. This effectively reduces circulation and creates equilibrium over time between those who had more money at the beginning than those who did not.

By using this modeling, we can anticipate the economic well-being both prior to and following the launch, enabling informed decision-making on the optimal strategies for construction. Subsequently, through ongoing evaluation and monitoring of the tokenomics, DAO members can collectively determine the most prudent course of action for prosperity.

Our collaboration with Machinations ensures that DAOs and projects with modeling needs have a practical tool at their disposal. It is a valuable resource, allowing them to confidently project the future potential of their community treasuries, fostering optimism and informed decision- -making, while delivering real time data.
