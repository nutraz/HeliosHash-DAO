Enhance hhdao-full-setup.sh: improved logging, --dry-run and --help support, plus documentation and CI validation.

Files added in this branch:
- `hhdao-full-setup.sh` (enhanced)
- `docs/hhdao-setup.md` (usage & guide)
- `.github/workflows/dry-run-validate.yml` (runs `--dry-run` on PRs)

Validation steps:
1. Run `./hhdao-full-setup.sh --dry-run` locally to preview actions.
2. CI will run the same dry-run and upload a log artifact for reviewers.

Notes:
- The full run performs system upgrades (may prompt for sudo). Review and run on a developer machine.
- If you want CI to skip certain steps, we can refine the workflow filters.

Please review and merge when ready.
