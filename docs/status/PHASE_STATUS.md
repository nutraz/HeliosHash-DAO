# Phase Status Summary (as of 2025-10-02)

## Phase A â€“ Stability & Truth âœ…

- Governance refactor complete (status enum, auto-finalization, consensusBps, voting window).
- Test helpers added (setConsensusBps, setVotingWindowSeconds, test mode flag).
- UI enhancements delivered (filtering, time remaining, vote progress, sorting).

## Phase B â€“ Token & Treasury (Parked Here) âœ… (Core Complete)

- Treasury canister refactored to thin interface delegating to `ledger.mo`.
- Pure logic module `ledger.mo` with mint/transfer/burn + minimal ICRC-1 (`icrc1_*`).
- Identity sync implemented (DAO-triggered balance push).
- Authorization guards: DAO-only mint/burn; one-time canister registration.
- Unit-testable logic: compiled pure tests; foundational script `scripts/test-treasury.sh`.
- Deployment automation: `scripts/deploy-pilot.sh` handles auth wiring.

Deferred (Documented):

- Full ICRC-1 (fees, duplicate detection, time windows).
- Subaccounts & metadata enrichment.
- Stable memory indexing for large tx logs.
- Integration test harness (post-pilot).

## Pilot (Phase C Kickoff Preparation) ðŸš€

Artifacts added:

- `PILOT.md` â€“ Operational loop spec (Urgam Valley Microgrid #1).
- Dataset: `data/microgrid/urgam_001_energy.csv` (sample week output).
- Proposal example: `examples/proposals/microgrid-urgam-001.json`.
- Proposal submission script: `scripts/create-proposal.sh`.
- Deployment script: `scripts/deploy-pilot.sh` (auth wiring included).
- VoiceNotes stub: `voice/README.md`.
- Hindi onboarding voice script: `voice/pilot_onboarding_hi.txt`.
- Auto-proposal & flags in `deploy-pilot.sh` (`--auto-proposal`, future `--auto-vote`).
- Frontend treasury integration: `treasuryService`, `useTreasuryMeta`, and `TreasuryCard` on dashboard.

## Recommended Immediate Pilot Flow

1. `./scripts/deploy-pilot.sh --network local`
2. Validate treasury meta + governance calls locally.
3. Submit example proposal JSON.
4. Simulate votes (multiple principals) â†’ verify auto-finalization.
5. Mint reward via DAO action (if not auto-wired yet â€“ confirm flow).
6. Prepare real partner principals; redeploy to `--network ic` after validation.

## Risk & Follow-ups

| Area             | Risk                                  | Mitigation                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ICRC Gaps        | External wallet compatibility partial | Communicate minimal subset; schedule upgrade        |
| Identity Sync    | Manual trigger only                   | Add periodic cron or event hook later               |
| Tx Growth        | In-memory array growth                | Plan stable chunked log (Phase D)                   |
| Proposal Schema  | Not strictly enforced cross modules   | Introduce candid type + validation guard            |
| Human Onboarding | Wallet UX friction                    | Provide minimal principal mapping instruction sheet |

## Next Candidates (Post-Pilot)

- Reputation weighting of votes.
- Energy-to-OWP adaptive reward curve.
- Multi-language proposal assistant (Whisper + summarizer integration).
- Treasury fee model + audit views.
