public let MAJOR_DECISION_THRESHOLD : Nat = 66; // >66% for major decisions
public let REVENUE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD : Nat = 75; // >75% for revenue allocation changes
public let EMERGENCY_RATIFICATION_HOURS : Nat = 48; // 48-hour emergency ratification
public let WOMENS_QUOTA_MINIMUM : Nat = 33; // 33% women's representation minimum
public let COMMUNITY_LEADERS_COUNT : Nat = 5; // 5 community leaders for multi-sig

  let edgeComputingPercent = (edgeComputingRevenue * 100) / totalRevenue;
  let speculativePercent = (speculativeRevenue * 100) / totalRevenue;

  {
    guaranteedInRange = (guaranteedPercent >= 60 and guaranteedPercent <= 70);
    edgeComputingInRange = (edgeComputingPercent >= 20 and edgeComputingPercent <= 30);

  let womenPercentage = (womenCount * 100) / totalCount;

  if (womenPercentage < WOMENS_QUOTA_MINIMUM) {
    #err("Women's representation below constitutional minimum of 33%")
  } else {
    #ok(candidates)
  }
};

public func enforceVotingThreshold(proposal: Proposal, votesFor: Nat, totalVotes: Nat) : Bool {
  let percentage = (votesFor * 100) / totalVotes;
  switch (proposal.proposalType) {
    case (#Constitutional) { percentage >= REVENUE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD };
