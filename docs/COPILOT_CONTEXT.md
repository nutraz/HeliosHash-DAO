# HeliosHash DAO ‚Äî AI Copilot Agent Instructions

## üéØ PROJECT VISION & STRATEGY

**HeliosHash DAO (HHDAO)** is India's implementation of the **One World Project (1WP)**, building a scalable model for decentralized solar infrastructure and community governance.

### Two-Phase National Rollout Strategy:

#### Phase 1: Baghpat Pilot (Micro-Scale Proof of Concept)
- **Location**: Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh (early supporter advantage)
- **Scope**: 5kW solar project (scalable to 50kW) - ‚Çπ60,00,000 INR starting budget
- **Objective**: Prove technology, governance, and community engagement models
- **Outcome**: Create replicable blueprint and secure approvals for Phase 2

#### Phase 2: Urgam Valley Special Economic Zone (Macro-Scale National Model)
- **Location**: Urgam Valley, Chamoli, Uttarakhand (12-village ecosystem)
- **Vision**: Self-sustained ecological energy zone dedicated to Kalpeshwar Mahadev
- **Scale**: 3MW capacity with 10km hi-tech infrastructure from Helang to Kalpeshwar Mahadev
- **Funding**: Global NFT participation with revenue returns - SEPARATE from KYC ID system

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION**: 
- Baghpat serves as DEMONSTRATION PROJECT only 
- Urgam Valley funded via GLOBAL NFT PARTICIPATION with revenue sharing
- KYC ID NFTs (for Indian users) and Investment NFTs (global participants) are SEPARATE systems

## üí∞ FUNDING ARCHITECTURE: DUAL NFT SYSTEM

### System 1: KYC ID NFTs (Indian Users Only)
```motoko
// For Indian citizen onboarding
- Aadhaar/PAN/retina verification required
- INR payments only
- Identity and access management
- NO revenue sharing - pure utility NFTs
```

### System 2: Investment NFTs (Global Participation)
```motoko
// For Urgam Valley funding worldwide
- Open global participation
- Crypto payments accepted
- Revenue sharing mechanisms
- Returns from UrgamU operations:
  * Micro data centers (8-12% projected returns)
  * Energy token ecosystem
  * Bitcoin mining revenue
  * Cloud services income
```

### Revenue Streams for Investment NFTs:
- **40%**: Cloud services from micro data centers
- **30%**: Blockchain infrastructure services
- **20%**: AI/ML computing capacity
- **10%**: Heat recapture monetization

## ü™ô TOKEN ECONOMICS: HHU/HHX DECISION PENDING

### Token Options Under Consideration:
- **HHU** (HeliosHash UrgamU) - Preferred, emphasizes UrgamU vision
- **HHX** (HeliosHash) - Alternative, broader branding

### Core Token Mechanics:
- **Distribution**: Participation rewards across both phases
- **Utility**: Unified governance + economic ecosystem access
- **Scope**: Single token system for micro ‚Üí macro scaling
