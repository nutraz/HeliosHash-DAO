# 🚨 CRITICAL: SECRET ROTATION REQUIRED

**⚠️ MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY ⚠️**

The repository cleanup process has removed the `.env` file that contained sensitive information. You must immediately rotate ALL secrets that were ever stored in that file to maintain security.

## 🔄 Required Secret Rotation Actions

### 1. Database Credentials
- [ ] Generate new database password
- [ ] Update database connection strings
- [ ] Test database connectivity with new credentials
- [ ] Revoke old database access

### 2. API Keys
- [ ] **Payment Gateway**: Rotate Razorpay keys (`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`)
- [ ] **Identity Verification**: Rotate Onfido token (`ONFIDO_TOKEN`)
- [ ] **Project Services**: Update project ID and related tokens
- [ ] **Internet Computer**: Regenerate canister deployment keys
- [ ] **Any third-party API keys** used in the application

### 3. Cryptographic Keys
- [ ] Rotate JWT signing secrets
- [ ] Generate new session secrets
- [ ] Update encryption keys (if any)
- [ ] Regenerate any blockchain private keys

### 4. Service Tokens
- [ ] OAuth application secrets
- [ ] GitHub tokens (if any)
- [ ] Docker registry credentials
- [ ] CDN tokens
- [ ] Monitoring service tokens

## 📋 Rotation Checklist

For each secret, follow this process:

1. **Generate New Secret**
   ```bash
   # Example for generating secure random secrets
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. **Update Production Environment**
   - Update environment variables in your hosting platform
   - Update CI/CD pipeline secrets
   - Update any containerized deployments

3. **Update Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Create new .env file (never commit this)
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your new secrets to .env
   ```

4. **Test New Credentials**
   - Verify all services work with new credentials
   - Run full application tests
   - Verify deployment process works

5. **Revoke Old Credentials**
   - Disable old API keys in service dashboards
   - Remove old database users
   - Invalidate old tokens

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After rotation, verify:

- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] All API integrations work
- [ ] Database connections successful
- [ ] Payment processing functional (if applicable)
- [ ] Authentication flows working
- [ ] Deployment process functions correctly

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Do not commit new secrets to the repository
- ❌ Do not reuse any old secrets
- ❌ Do not skip testing after rotation
- ❌ Do not forget to revoke old credentials

## ✅ Security Benefits

Once completed, you will have:
- 🔒 All secrets properly secured
- 🚫 No sensitive data in repository history
- 🔄 Fresh credentials with no exposure risk
- 📋 Documented security practices

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues during secret rotation:
1. Check service documentation for credential management
2. Verify environment variable names and formats
3. Test credentials individually before full deployment
4. Keep old credentials active until new ones are verified working
