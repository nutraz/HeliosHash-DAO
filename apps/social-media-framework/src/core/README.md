This folder contains core orchestration logic for the social media framework.

- `SocialMediaOrchestrator.ts` — main orchestration flow
- `ContentStrategyManager.ts` — generates content items from project configs and templates

Files are intentionally minimal and include TODO markers for real implementations.
