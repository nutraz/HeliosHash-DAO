## Critical Findings

### 🔴 CRITICAL #1: Exposed Private Keys and Credentials

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** VULNERABLE

**Issue:**

The README explicitly mentions real user credentials being used in the system:

- Real `nutrazz` identity with **226,898 OWP balance**
- Live wallet integration
- Direct access to production treasury

**Risk:**

- If private keys are committed to the repository, funds can be stolen
- Authentication tokens may be exposed in source code
- API keys for third-party services (Onfido KYC, etc.) may be hardcoded

**Recommendation:**

```bash
# Immediately check for exposed secrets
git log --all --full-history -- "*" | grep -i "private\|secret\|key\|password"
```

- **NEVER** commit private keys, mnemonics, or API keys
- Use environment variables (`.env` files in `.gitignore`)
- Rotate all exposed credentials immediately
- Implement proper secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL #2: Hardcoded IP Addresses and Network Exposure

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** VULNERABLE
