# HeliosHash DAO Constitution v3.0 - Reality Check Edition

_Honest Development Phases for Real Solar Infrastructure_

## Phase 1: Prototype Validation (Current - 30 days)

**Goal**: Prove the concept works with real people and real money

### Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Build 5kW co-ownership MVP platform
=======
- Build 50kW co-ownership MVP platform
>>>>>>> audit-clean
- Find 3 real investors willing to test with actual money (minimum ₹1000 each)
- Validate that ownership calculations work correctly
- Test platform usability with real users

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 3 people invest real money and use the platform
- [ ] Math works: ownership percentages calculate correctly
- [ ] Users can see their energy shares and revenue splits
- [ ] At least 1 written testimonial that platform is useful

### Kill Criteria (If any occur → pivot or shut down)

- Cannot find 2 people willing to test the idea
- Platform math doesn't work or causes disputes
- Users find platform too complex to understand

## Phase 2: Local Pilot (If Phase 1 succeeds - 6 months)

**Goal**: Prove the revenue model works in practice

### Requirements

- Deploy actual 50kW solar system in accessible location
- Manage real electricity generation and sales
- Handle real revenue distribution to co-owners
- Document all challenges and learnings

### Success Criteria

- Positive cash flow from energy sales
- All co-owners receive expected returns
- System operates reliably for 6 months
- Local authorities comfortable with setup

## Phase 3: Urgam Valley (If Phase 2 succeeds - 2027+)

**Goal**: Scale to remote deployment with full blockchain infrastructure

### Requirements

- All the DAO governance features currently in codebase
- Government partnerships and regulatory approvals
- 1WP token integration and treasury management
- Multi-site deployment across Uttarakhand

### Success Criteria

- Self-sustaining community energy system
- Active DAO governance with meaningful decisions
- Measurable improvement in local quality of life
- Model ready for replication in other valleys

## Current Reality (October 2025)

**What we have**: A well-architected blockchain platform with solid frontend engineering
**What we're building**: A 30-day validation test with 3 real co-owners
**What we will NOT claim**: Production readiness until we have actual solar panels generating power

## Governance During Reality Check Phase

- No token voting until Phase 3
- Decisions made by consensus among active co-owners
- Focus on learning and iteration, not grand governance
- Monthly progress reports to all stakeholders
